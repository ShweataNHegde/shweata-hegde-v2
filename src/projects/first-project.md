## The Story
Why are Plants Green? Why Do Birds Fly in Groups? How Do Flowers Bloom? 

I'm sure we all have asked such curious questions about the world we observe, more so when we are younger. 

Back in 2021, as a first year undergrad, I was struck by how my high school education did not recognise or nurture my curiosity. It was all exams, exams and exams (not to blame the teachers).

 Along with Ruchi Manglunia who also shared the same frustration, I started a passion project, IndiaAskWhy (www.indiaaskswhy.org) podcast to explore such curious science-y questions. Our goal was make episodes exploring curious questions and find a way to reach it to students.

Luckily, IndiaBioscience found potential in our project and hosted our season 01. And for the next two years starting in late 2021, we managed to get a grant called IndiaBioscience Outreach Grant. Having the grant was huge, it enabled us to invest more of our time, have a professional team, visit schools. and more!
