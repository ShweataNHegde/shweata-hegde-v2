Why are Plants Green? Why Do Birds Fly in Groups? How Do Flowers Bloom?

I'm sure we all have asked similar curious questions about the world we observe. Possibly more so when we are younger.

In 2021, as a first-year undergrad, I realised how my high school or college education did not recognise or nurture my curiosity. It was all exams, exams and exams (not to blame the teachers). While discussing this issue with Ruchi at a science workshop, an idea struck. Why don't we start a podcast to explore curious questions (like the ones posed at the beginning)? That's how IndiaAsksWhy (www.indiaaskswhy.org) was born.

We tied up with IndiaBioscience for the first season. Soon, we managed to get a grant called the IndiaBioscience Outreach Grant. The two-year funding has enabled us to invest more time in the idea, produce more episodes, have a professional team, visit schools, and more!

We've come a long way. A conversation turned into a hobby project turned into a full-blown science communication project. We've produced 16 episodes and reached thousands of students. Professionally, I've learnt a lot of skills -- scripting, researching, interviewing, audio-editing, managing a team, and running events.
