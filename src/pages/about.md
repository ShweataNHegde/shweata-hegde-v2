I'm Shweata. I'm a science podcaster and writer, an open source developer and a science educator (to be). I love wearing multiple hats (like you can tell) and learning something new all the time! The website is an attempt to curate my work, learnings and ramblings. 

If any of what you see on my website excites you, feel free to reach out to me! I would love to hear and learn from you :)
