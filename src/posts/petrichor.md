Imagine a warm, sunny day and it gets cloudy all of a sudden. It is the first rain in a long time. With a hot cup of tea, you sit back to enjoy the light rain. And that's when the earthy warm smell in the air hits your nose. Petrichor. Ever wondered what's responsible for this smell?

_Streptomyces_, one of the most abundant bacteria in soil and some plants, produce a volatile compound called geosmin. When the raindrop hits the ground, tiny bubbles are produced at the point of contact with the soil. These bubbles rise up encapsulating bacterial compounds like geosmin and burst into aerosols. When the wind blows, these geosmin laden aerosols reach your nose. Some animals including humans are extremely sensitive to geosmin and can sense it when present in trace quantities.

But, why do these bacteria produce geosmin? To give humans a sense of joy during rains? No, there is more to it. A recent study shows that Springtails, wingless arthropods, are attracted to geosmin produced by sporulating colonies of _Streptomyces_. Springtails, in turn, feed on the _Streptomyces_ and spread the bacterial spores through their faeces. The spores sometimes also hitch-hike on the hydrophobic surface of Springtails. Therefore, Springtails act as vectors of _Streptomyces_ spore dispersion.

Though geosmin is a chemoattractant produced for dispersal of _Streptomyces_ spores, its warm smell also disperses joy during rains!
