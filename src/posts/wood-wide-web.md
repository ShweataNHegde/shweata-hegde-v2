Buried deep under the soil are laced strands that traverse long distances and form a web. This web connects all the devices (read trees!) & is used for communication. Of course, we are talking about WWW — not the World Wide Web but the **Wood** Wide Web!

Researchers have long known that certain fungi form associations with the roots of the trees. They help in fixing nitrogen, and in return, the trees give them food. That is all the exchange that happens or so we thought until Dr. Suzzane Simard, a passionate forest researcher, came along.

In 1997, she uncovered that the connection between fungi and trees was not a one-to-one relationship. Instead, each fungus associates with many trees and a tree root can associate with different species of fungi! This interlinkage, or the fungal-root network, creates channels for trees to exchange nutrition & information between different individuals.

Older trees transfer food to younger ones to help them survive. Dying trees give up their stored food to the ones thriving. Using this linkage, an affected tree can also “inform” its neighbor about an ongoing threat. But just like any other community, there are bad players too. A tree or a plant from a different species might “hack” the system & “corrupt” some food that was going elsewhere.

Though technological advances have helped us map & understand these underground networks in forests, unknowns remain. The vastness & complexity of the network make it harder for researchers to study them in their entirety & understand the nutrition and information transfer mechanisms.

Unfortunately, deforestation is disrupting these vital networks. Restoration efforts often focus on re-growing single tree species in isolation, neglecting the restoration of the underground networks, which leads to poorly developed forests.

So the next time you see trees, appreciate the myriads of underground fungal-root networks that connect them. Beneath your feet is a complex information & food exchange system silently buzzing all the time!
