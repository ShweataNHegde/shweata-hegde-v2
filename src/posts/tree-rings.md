Tree Rings: Life’s Morse code encrypting the secrets of the world’s (past) climate.

You might be familiar with the famous Morse code, a set of codes containing long and short signals for each character, used in wars to encrypt top-secret messages. Trees, it turns out, have their own version of Morse code, and they are tree rings!

Counting tree rings will tell you its age. But there is a lot more to it! The rings can tell us the climate story of the past long before measurements were recorded!

Let’s track back and understand how tree rings are formed. Firstly, not all trees have tree rings. The ones growing in temperate or even trophic regions respond to the seasonality by forming variable rings. Trees form larger rings in favourable conditions like spring or wet conditions - characterized by a light shade of wood - known as Earlywood. At the same time, they grow a smaller ring in the autumn or dry season, which are darker and compact, known as Latewood. Earlywood and Latewood form a year’s tree ring.

If there was a drought one summer, the ring grows narrower. If there was a wildfire, we see that in its rings. This is how numerous tree species, some living for thousands of years, encode the climate in their rings as they age. Across thousands of trees, researchers can pattern match and cross-date, reference, and analyze the rings to paint an accurate picture of the past.

If you’re wondering if researchers go around stumping trees- worry not! They use an instrument called a Hollow Borer to carefully take out a chunk of wood from the tree stem to analyze its rings. What you should be concerned about is what researchers have decrypted about the past climate. In almost all kinds of trees sensitive to temperature, we find evidence of unprecedented global warming caused by humans.

These trees will continue to add rings, encrypting the status of the climate, one year at a time. But by the actions we take, humans have the power to determine the kinds of rings they will form in the future!

On a less serious note, tree rings have spilt secrets about archaeology, geography, and so much more!
