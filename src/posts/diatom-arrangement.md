Intricacies of life are mind-boggling. One such intricate beauty comes in the form of microscopic diatoms, the photosynthetic alga found in all water forms. With an estimated 100,000 known species, they are the most diverse and visually stunning forms of eukaryotes.

Their outer shells known as “frustules” sets them apart. The frustules, made of inorganic silica (aka glass), have beautiful species-specific nanopatterns. First descriptions of diatoms date back to 1700s – they intrigued early microscopists peering through their lenses, because of their geometry and ornamentation.

Then came the microscopists of the Victorian era, who turned their slides into canvas, and arranged these beautiful little ones into miniature mandalas, perfectly blending art and science. The earliest of the diatom arrangements date back to the 1800s, reaching its peak in the latter part of the 19th century. Though the art was sought by many naturalists, it slowly died off along with its microscopists.

Klaus Kemp, a self-taught diatom artist, has now brought back life to this beautiful art form. He was 16 when he first saw the diatom arrangement of the Victorian era. The art begins with collecting, prepping and cleaning the diatoms. The artist then meticulously, for hours or days, arranges individual cells with a hair or needle into beautiful designs.

Contemplating life’s beauty, Charles Darwin once said, “Few objects are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of diatoms: were they only created to be admired under the microscope?” But thanks to advanced technology and tools (cameras!), you don’t *need* to own a microscope to admire the beauty of these symmetrical beauties! 

Diatoms are estimated to contribute 20% of the oxygen that we breathe. We can’t help but marvel at these omnipresent wonders, unseen to naked eyes! To put it in Kemp’s words: “For anything to be so intricate, so well-sculptured, it is just astounding!”
