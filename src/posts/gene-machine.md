Ever wonder what it's like to be a lab scientist? Nobel Laureate Venki Ramakrishnan, in his memoir, takes us through his journey – the race to decipher the structure of a fundamental molecule of life, the “ribosome”. Literally, every molecule of the cell is either made by ribosomes or by enzymes which are themselves made by ribosomes.

From a false start in physics to stumbling into the ‘unfashionable' ribosome; from not knowing how to hold a pipette at his second stint in grad school to sharing the Nobel prize with his rivals (Yonath and Steitz), from being rejected for 50 faculty positions to becoming the President of the Royal Society – the author shares an honest, insecure, personal, and humbling account of being in academia.

His writing throws light on the complex interplay between competition & collaboration in science; the fuzzy line between the two, the messiness, politics and pitfalls of science, the sometimes-toxic scientific culture & dynamics. Most importantly, the human nature of science. After all, science is a collective human endeavor.

Through his experiences, he explains how connecting dots and asking the right questions is not enough for breakthroughs. Luck and peoples' kindness play a collective role. He appreciates the many individuals who played key collaborative roles in his research. He admits nothing can ever match the utopic feeling he felt when they finally solved the ribosome's 30S structure- when years of research finally paid off!

Finally, he highlights how prizes like the Nobel Prize don't hold good with the industrial nature of science. Nothing happens in isolation. Awarding three individuals out of countless contributors is fundamentally flawed, according to him.

The book gets slightly technical at times, but adequate background information combined with the author's lucid writing style make it easy for any reader to follow.

Gene Machine is a must-read for anyone who is up for a thrilling roller coaster journey with the author to decipher the ribosome. As passengers, we get to experience the very human nature of science & a lot more!
