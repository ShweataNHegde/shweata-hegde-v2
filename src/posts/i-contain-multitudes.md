Who are you? Are you 'just' you? In the answer to the question lies the fundamental yet overlooked aspect of all life, “symbiosis” - our beautiful, messy, complicated relationship with microbes.

Science Journalist Ed Yong writes about how the life that we see is driven by life unseen in ways unfathomable. From high tech labs to oceans & isolated islands, Yong takes us on a grand tour introducing researchers globally who play a unified chord towards understanding symbiosis. With an equal number of bacteria and human cells in our body - ‘we are half the people we think we are’. The microbiome plays a huge role in sculpting organs, digestion, defence, behavior, and so much more!

The book begins with the story of the origin of life, the seemingly improbable event of the union of an archaeon and bacteria giving birth to eukaryotes – a beautiful example of symbiosis that we all carry. The book is a departure from associating symbiosis with icons like lichens and corals. It is loaded with wondrous tales from all niches of animals (sorry botanists!) & microbial life revealing the intricacies of their relationships in the web of life. You’d be surprised to know the role of breast milk in shaping our microbiome & about the viruses in mucus which we control to control our microbes.

Ed Yong recounts the history of discovery of microbes as “curious little beings” by Leeuwenhoek, and later its rediscovery in a harmful light thanks to germ theory in Darwinian times. Recently, microbes have gotten ‘positive’ attention with the advent of probiotics. Ed Yong explains that microbes are neither protagonists nor antagonists in our story. Relationships between us & microbes are complex - we cannot make sense of life while looking at either of them as isolates or without fully understanding such relationships.

The book will make us rethink our understanding of life. We are ecosystems - islands inhabited by thousands of species negotiating with each other for their own survival. You (and your multitudes!) will be up for an enthralling ride exploring all lifeforms’ beauty and complexity!
