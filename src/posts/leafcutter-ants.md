Who knew that a tri-party relationship between ants, fungi and bacteria could teach us about antimicrobial resistance? Let‚Äôs learn!

Leafcutter ants can strip almost 17% of the leaf biomass from plants, but they don‚Äôt eat the leaves that they cut. Instead, they clean and convert leaves into manure, using it as fertilizer to grow their crop: fungus! The fungus (L. _gongylophorus_) then consumes the leaf and forms fruiting bodies on which the ants feast.

Just like weeds in farms compete for food and space, these fungi cultivated by the leafcutter ants are also vulnerable to antagonists' attacks, which typically comes from competing fungi, _Escovopsis_. But these ants have their version of pesticides - antifungals!

Apart from secreting the antifungals, the ants also have a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with bacteria on their body. These bacteria also produce antifungals to keep out the antagonist _Escovopsis_.

Given that the battle has been going on for millions of years, _Escovopsis_ has developed resistance. But the ants have countered too, and the bacterial symbionts provide flexibility. They can mix-n-match their genes easily, making it easier to produce a slightly different cocktail of antifungals. Bacteria reproduce faster than ants, making it easier to come up with antifungals to combat a new version of _Escovopsis_. Indirectly, the bacterial symbionts protect the fungal monoculture (L. _gongylophorus_) of the colony.

This ever-evolving chemical battle might hold answers to solving the antimicrobial resistance problem humans will have to tackle shortly since a growing number of pathogens are becoming resistant to antimicrobials. Researchers can study the coevolution between the bacterial symbiont and antagonist fungi, to get insights into developing new antimicrobials!
