We all know that plants, algae and some bacteria have the superpower to photosynthesize. But can animals do the same?

Some animals, including corals, some species of sea anemones, and worms, can photosynthesize by forming a relationship with photosynthetic algae, in a process known as endosymbiosis. Often, these animals are dependent on the endosymbionts for their food requirements.

Interestingly, Leaf Sheep and _Elysia_ - types of sea slugs - have taken it a notch further. Why make chloroplasts when you can steal them? Instead of hosting the whole algae in their bodies, they strip the chloroplast from the algal food and line their digestive tracts with it, by a phenomenon known as kleptoplasty. In case of unavailability of food, these translucent solar-powered slugs bask in the sun and let the chloroplasts work. Researchers estimate that some species can keep the chloroplasts active in their tracts for several months.

Although it sounds fascinating, the art of stealing chloroplasts is harder than you think! These sea slugs have to strip off just the chloroplast from their algal food and also retain them as functional for a longer duration. Additionally, they have to protect them from their body’s own defense mechanism. Most importantly, these slugs must possess algal genes in their cellular nuclei, necessary to sustain the chloroplasts. The slugs also need to biochemically modify these chloroplasts to reduce the harm caused by reactive species produced in the process of photosynthesis.

Many details about this phenomenon are controversial, and the underpinnings of the mechanism are relatively unknown. Difficulty in finding these animals only makes it harder. Chloroplasts are thought to be a cyanobacterium which formed a permanent relationship with a eukaryote, billions of years ago. Understandings about the solar-powered slugs might provide insights into how photosynthetic algae evolved and much more.

Until researchers unveil the mysteries of these curious little ones, let’s not forget to marvel at the beauties of nature.
