Can infecting mosquitoes with a specific bacteria save humanity from a debilitating viral disease?

Dengue, a hugely neglected disease that plagues 400 millions people each year, is spread through the bite of the female _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The mosquito becomes a carrier when she takes the blood of a person infected with the virus.

With no antiviral therapies or vaccines, the only way of controlling the disease is by killing the mosquitoes and preventing breeding. What else can we do to reduce transmission?

That’s where _Wolbachia_, a bacteria present in 60% of all insects (but *not* naturally in _Aedes_ mosquito), comes into the picture. Surprisingly, when researchers infected the mosquito egg with _Wolbachia_, it altered the adult hosts’ workings and prevented the viral replication cycle upon infection.

But transmission reduction is effective only if the majority mosquito population has Wolbachia. How can we achieve that?

The bacteria has several tricks up its sleeve! When _Wolbachia_-infected females mate with either Wolbachia infected or uninfected male, their children have _Wolbachia_ in their cells. However, when uninfected females mate with the infected male, the egg never hatches. This manipulative trick is known as cytoplasmic incompatibility. By introducing lots of infected mosquitoes into an area and letting them reproduce over several generations, nearly all will have _Wolbachia_.

Trials in Indonesia, headed by World Mosquito Program, show 77% disease reduction in areas where the researchers released the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes compared to a similar area where they didn’t. Wolbachia, once introduced in the population, will remain in the population, making it a self-sustainable approach. Independent studies have shown that Wolbachia carrying mosquitoes are no threat to humans or the environment.

Due to decades of research and worldwide testing, we can also translate this method to other diseases that mosquitoes transmit, like Zika and Malaria. The story of the _Wolbachia_ method feels like a breath of fresh air in a suffocating world crippled by the ongoing pandemic.
