The food on your plate is invariably a product of one of the most important processes on the planet, photosynthesis. But did you know that there is a major flaw at the heart of photosynthesis?

This has to do with the key enzyme that goes by the mouthful name, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, which sits scattered in the chloroplast of cells in most plants (1st image). Involved in the fixation of inorganic carbon to organic carbon, RuBisCO, is literally at the crossroads of life. However, it is lazy and inefficient at its job. Instead of fixing only CO2, it uses oxygen about 25% of the time. This mainly because RubisCO evolved in a nearly oxygen free atmosphere, a few billion years ago.

The oxygenated product is toxic and the plant needs to invest energy to recycle it. To compensate for the loss of photosynthetic efficiency, most plants produce RuBisCO in large quantities, making it one of the most abundant enzymes in the biosphere. The inefficiency of RuBisCO is one of the limiting factors of photosynthesis.

Interestingly, some bacteria, algae and hornworts have developed a Carbon-Concentrating Mechanism (CCM) to get around this problem. Unlike plants, _Chlamydomonas_ and other photosynthetic green algae concentrate RuBisCO into a compartment called pyrenoid inside the chloroplasts. They employ carbon transporters and carbon leakage preventers to enhance the CO2 concentration, up to 50 folds, in the pyrenoid. This way RuBisCO fixes only CO2, and by proxy, the photosynthetic efficiency goes up.

A lot of research has gone into better understanding the CCM, in the hopes of introducing it into higher plants. Enhancing photosynthesis is seen to be one of the ways to improve food security in world moving towards a population boom. Successful introduction of CCM into crop plants would also mean more people having sufficient food on their plates and will ensure sustainability.
